# Deep-Learning-And-Image-Analysis-of-Bacterial-Colonies-with-PyTorch

### Project Overview
This is an ongoing project. In microbiology, counting bacterial colonies is essential but time-consuming. This project automates colony counting through a YOLOv5 deep learning model trained to identify bacterial colonies. It is highly applicable in automating repetitive lab tasks. The model has to undergo fine-tuning and further analysis to improve key accuracy metrics.
This project utilizes YOLOv5 for the automated detection of bacterial colonies in lab-cultured samples. By leveraging the power of deep learning, specifically object detection, this model can identify and quantify bacterial colonies in high-resolution images, enabling faster analysis for researchers and lab technicians.
